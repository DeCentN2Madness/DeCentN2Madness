### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [the Adamint @ Pi Place](https://theadamint.com/preview) & the [Haskell Dev Pro][Video2Anim] course from [Emurgo Academy][ea].
- 🌱 I’m currently studying **haskell**, **plutus**, **nix** and **gratitude for life** for the most part these days and loving it all.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **_trivial_ open sourced haskell projects**, especially in humanities and/or [Cardano][cardano] while I learn Haskell and Plutus (always).
- 📫 How to reach me: **[discussions](https://github.com/DeCentN2Madness/DeCentN2Madness/discussions) are open** for _whatever_ you have in mind. For example, [@DeZinerly][dz] and I came up with a [**_fantastic_**][cc] recipe for a Keto (in moderation) and [GAPS][gaps] carrot cake that's better than any sugar-bomb version I've ever had—and I probably had a few too many of those chronic heart disease raffle tickets before waking up. 😉
- 💬 Ask me **anything**; srsly. I double dog dare ya. 😅 Of course, if you just want to razz me… I beat you to it. 😛
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy producing and performing roadhouse electronica funk jazz hard rock with a touch of "[wtf was that?][sam]" and "did you catch that break?" thrown in for odd times and [places][odd].
- 🎱 Answer: That which was asked about was written and recorded in a weekend hotel stay for my Euterpe (AKA DeZinerly) as we parted beyond a day for the first time.
